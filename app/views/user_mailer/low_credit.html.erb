<p>Dear opeNode user, <br /></p>
<p>Please note that your account now has less than <%= @user.nb_credits_threshold_notification %> credits and your websites will stop when no more credit will be available. Note that you can change this notification threshold (<%= @user.nb_credits_threshold_notification %>) in Admin > My Account > Notifications</p>

<p>To overcome this issue, you can buy credits in 
<strong>Administration > Billing</strong>, it is cheap and your websites 
will continue running smoothly. </p>
<p>If you have any question please let us know.<br /></p>
